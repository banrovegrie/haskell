## ABOP syntax

The book "Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" uses a specialized syntax for
specifying L-systems. I started writing a parser for it, but it became messy
and I decided to write the internal logic before the parser.

Here I have a few samples of this syntax (from ABOP) and a little vim syntax
highlighting file I wrote for it.
